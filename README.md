A tutorial I am currently studying designed to teach the basics of game design, written in Java using Eclipse.

The code written so far is the work of YouTube channel RealTutsGML, although I have typed every line of code so far in an effort to fully understand each step of the process. Once I've completed the project, I intend to experiment and expand upon the existing code.
